### A voice-interaction English language practice programme developed using Streamlit and the OpenAI API. 

- **User Interface**: Participants interact with the system through a web application (see Figure below), speaking via a 'Record' button, and receiving voice responses. The interface also displays the system's latest response and the conversation history.
- **Language Model**: We employ the 'gpt-3.5-turbo' model, using up to 3 rounds of preceding user-system exchanges (equivalent to 6 preceding speaking turns) as contextual input for generating responses.
